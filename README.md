# hello-world
This is the first trial of opening a repository.
Sorry, there's nothing to do yet for you, but be sure:
I have so many questions, ideas and paths which I want to follow up, but where I'm stuck. I wish to share and develop them with you:
- Mathematics
- Programming
- Graphical projects
- Science and technologies.

Let me get some experiences in using GitHub.
I will come back to you and look forward for a cooperation.
Thank you in advance.
