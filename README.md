# hello-world
First trial of opening a repository

I deleted the first read me because I didn't really understand how to use GitHub and what is it good for. So it's more a restart of this repository.

Ok, now I opened a new branch.

I understand, that I can put a question here or an issue to be discussed. But I'm not sure. Is somebody here to guide me?
